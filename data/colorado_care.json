          "DESCRIPTION": "SUNDAY*** For Adams County \"ColoradoCare\" Leaders\\, Neighbors  and Volunteers: \"A \"Just-Drop-In Open House\"\\, \"Meet n Greet\\,\" and ColoradoCare \"Phone Banking\" Event\\n\\n***Especially for our \"friends who already like ColoradoCareYES\" but also including \"the very curious\\, the spontaneous\\, and those who simply have to know more about our \"Adams County Insiders' Game Plan\" for a BIG\\, some say \"juuuge\\,\" YES!Vote electoral win on CC A-69 in Adams County on November 8 . . . Please stop by and say Hi . . . \\n\\nHello To Our \"Friends Who Like ColoradoCareYES\\,\"\\nWe will be gathering from 5-8 pm at the Villas at Sunny Acres where we've held earlier CC phone banks (Please come to The Villager Lounge\\, on the basement floor level -- inside and to the left -- of The Villager Building Entrance (with its adjoining guest parking) at 2511 E. 104th Ave.\\, Thornton\\, CO 80233-6168 (My cell is 720-275-4399 for directions\\, questions\\, etc.) . . . \\n\\n(A)    FOR THIS \"Open House\" and \"Meet n Greet\"  . . . Just show up\\; bring refreshments to share if you can\\, or not\\; Be prepared\\, or not\\, to ask questions about how we are moving forward to pass ColoradoCare in Adams County: Get ready to do whatever you can to help us achieve our \"Adams County Path to Victory for ColoradoCare Amendment 69 on November 8\\, 2016\" . . . Have fun\\; Meet some keen people\\; Have fun!  Ken Connell will be your Host!  (My cell is 720-275-4399) . . .\\n\\n(B)    FOR A VERY POSITIVE  EXPERIENCE WITH \"ColoradoCare Phone Banking\" . . . Please Try It Before You Decide Not To Like It (as Many Of Our Volunteer Callers Actually like It As We Are Doing It) . . . \\n\\nHere are the details for Sunday's calling . . . \\nKen Connell will be your Host and Trainer for this calling event . . . His cell no. is 720-275-4399 . . . Ken has great call lists of ColoradoCare \"friendlies\" . . . You'll work from a dynamic\\, highly motivating script for talking with those who may still be learning about ColoradoCare Amendment 69\\, those who are very much in the know\\, many CC active supporters and prior donors\\, and just about anyone and everyone your calls may actually reach in person . . . All call results have simple codes for reporting so future call lists will be current and updated within the VAN data base . . . We are very successful in thanking our supporters\\, gauging the strength of their support\\, engaging them as volunteers\\, and securing additional financial donations from those who are ready\\, willing and able to do more at the time of our calls . . . \\nWe will meet from 5 pm\\, to start the brief training of our phone bank callers so can begin making calls before 5:30 pm . . . We're requesting a minimum calling shift of 2 hours from the end of the training\\, but we have the space reserved until 9:00 pm\\, for any who can commit to more than two hours of calling . . . Callers will need to provide cell phones (and should bring a charger) to make calls . . . Callers are also encouraged to bring refreshments to share\\, as they can\\, or not . . . \\n\\nAdditional Location and Directions Detail):  The phone banking address is at 2511 E. 104th Ave in The Villager Building Lounge (on the ground floor of the building where I live) on the campus of The Villas At Sunny Acres (VASA) in Thornton CO 80233-6168 . . . This is a 64-acre campus so one will need to follow the campus signs that specifically identify \"The Villager\" . . . (Do not go to \"The Villa\" building) . . . Please look for ColoradoCare on signs near those pointing the way to The Villager Building -- starting at the preferred front entrance next to the five-story Ambassador building at the Eastern-most entrance . . . (NOTE: There are actually two different entrances onto the campus from East 104th Ave by car (both to the north side just east of York St) . . . Either will lead into \"The Villager\" (a 4-story building on the northeast end of the campus) at the most northerly end of the paved roads by either entrance) . . . \\n\\nPlease map the \"The Villager\" address so you can see the basic location of \"The Villager\" on the Villas at Sunny Acres campus . . . Thanks very much for calling to help pass ColoradoCare Amendment 69 . . . \\n\\nHope to see you this Sunday . . .\\n720-275-4399",

We are very successful in thanking our supporters\\, gauging the strength of their support\\, engaging them as volunteers\\, and securing additional financial donations from those who are ready\\, willing and able to do more at the time of our calls . . . \\nWe will meet from 5 pm\\, to start the brief training of our phone bank callers so can begin making calls before 5:30 pm . . . We're requesting a minimum calling shift of 2 hours from the end of the training\\, but we have the space reserved until 9:00 pm\\, for any who can commit to more than two hours of calling . . . Callers will need to provide cell phones (and should bring a charger) to make calls . . . Callers are also encouraged to bring refreshments to share\\, as they can\\, or not . . . \\n\\nAdditional Location and Directions Detail):  The phone banking address is at 2511 E. 104th Ave in The Villager Building Lounge (on the ground floor of the building where I live) on the campus of The Villas At Sunny Acres (VASA) in Thornton CO 80233-6168 . . . This is a 64-acre campus so one will need to follow the campus signs that specifically identify \"The Villager\" . . . (Do not go to \"The Villa\" building) . . . Please look for ColoradoCare on signs near those pointing the way to The Villager Building -- starting at the preferred front entrance next to the five-story Ambassador building at the Eastern-most entrance . . . (NOTE: There are actually two different entrances onto the campus from East 104th Ave by car (both to the north side just east of York St) . . . Either will lead into \"The Villager\" (a 4-story building on the northeast end of the campus) at the most northerly end of the paved roads by either entrance) . . . \\n\\nPlease map the \"The Villager\" address so you can see the basic location of \"The Villager\" on the Villas at Sunny Acres campus . . . Thanks very much for calling to help pass ColoradoCare Amendment 69 . . . \\n\\nHope to see you this Sunday . . .\\n720-275-4399",

Prior to the November election\\, we need to increase our volunteer capacity so accurate information is disseminated to the public.\\n\\n An example of a volunteer activity: a 2- hour shift at either the Buena Vista or the Salida Farmers Market to provide ColoradoCare education through conversation and/or a ColoradoCare flyer or other printed materials. Each farmers market will have two volunteers\\, one at a table and the other circulating through the market. \\n\\n An example of a speaker activity: speak to a local organization\\, church\\, business\\, or neighborhood group.\\n\\n Volunteers will also be needed for additional outreach venues that are being planned.\\n\\n We hope you will join us for a potluck dinner and training!\\n\\n Please RSVP to Joe Lyford: 719-221-6764 or joehlyfordjr@gmail.com\\n",

BRING A SIDE DISH OR DRINKS TO SHARE WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS!  RSVP by Friday July 30!\\n\\nIt’s time to begin organizing for a win for Colorado Care!  As you know Colorado Care is a game changer.  The passage of this referendum by the people of Colorado will replace the current insurance industry system with Colorado Care.  Colorado Care eliminates the middlemen who restrict access to healthcare while at the same time make excessive profits.  It is a well conceived payment system that provides comprehensive health care for your children\\, grandchildren and parents and for your friends and neighbors living in Colorado and for you in times of misfortune.  We invite everyone to “Do the Math!” and compare their healthcare cost under the current insurance industry system and Colorado Care at  http://www.coloradocare.org/for-you/calculate-your-savings/  You can also Do the Math and look at more information on Colorado Care attached to this email.\\n\\nWe are hosting our first Denver City and County organization party at my home located at 530 Yosemite Way Denver 80230 on Saturday July 30 at 10 am.  We will have our field directors\\, Joel Dyar and Jeriel Brammeier\\, at this meeting to show us how to educate voters on Colorado Care and how to get out the vote using  VAN and mini-VAN.  We will organize these efforts using the eight State House Districts within the city.  For each of the 8 house districts we will need at least one community leader\\, a data captain and many canvassers and people who like to talk to voters on the phone.  Please let me know if you are willing to take on any of these house district leadership roles.  Your help and input is greatly appreciated! \\n\\nAt the conclusion of this training\\, we invite you to stay for a BBQ including pulled pork sandwiches.  Please invite your friends and family to this event and let me know if you can attend by Fri July 29.  Please also bring a side dish or drink to share!\\n\\n530 Yosemite Way Denver CO  80230 is located just East of the Big Bear Ice Arena.  Take Lowry Blvd East from Quebec (Lowry Blvd is between Alameda and 6th Avenue 50 North) to the third roundabout.  At the third roundabout drive South on Yosemite Way and it is the first house on the left with the rocking horse on the porch.\\n\\nRSVP to Steve (steve4allseasons@gmail.com) by July 29 if you can attend",
