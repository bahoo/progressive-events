Most people believe that the story is about hypocrisy. The priest and the Levite are people who should have helped the injured man lying on the side of the road, but they didn't. While it is true that they should have stopped and helped, this is not how the original hearers of the parable would have understood it. </p> <p>The priest and the Levite represent groups of people well know by Jesus' first century audience, and they would not have been at all surprised by the priest and Levite's failure to intervene. On this show we will put the story of the Good Samaritan in it's context and apply it to our modern world so that we can better understand the meaning of the text and how Jews in the first century would have seen it. </p> <p>Please feel free to attend and be on the show. If you can't make it, be sure to listen to our show. You will be able to find it at <a href=""http://www.modernlectionaries.blogspot.com"">www.modernlectionaries.blogspot.com</a> You can also find a sample of what show will be about in my recent May Day speech, also found on my blog.

Too often modern readers understand pride and arrogance as being haughty or full of one's self. When we call someone prideful or arrogant, we think of personal characteristics of individuals who brag or think they are better than us. This is not all of what first century Jews and Christians would have thought.<br/>Instead, early Christians would have thought of the rich and the powerful. They would of thought of bringing the arrogant down from their thrones and ""sending the rich away empty"" (Luke 1:52-53).
